<h2>Description</h2>

    Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish composed of layers of wide, flat pasta
    sheets alternated with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel, and an

    perfection, the dish emerges from the oven with a golden, bubbly crust,
    exuding a savory aroma that invites hearty appetites. Its flavorful,
    comforting taste makes it a popular choice for family gatherings and festive
    occasions.

<h2>Steps to make the recipe</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>
        In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add
        the chopped onion and cook until translucent.
    </li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li>
        Add the ground beef or sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned,
        breaking up the meat as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Add
        the sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for
        about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1/4 cup grated
        Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>Place 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
    <li>Top with 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>
        Repeat layers (sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella) two more
        times, ending with a layer of noodles and remaining meat sauce on top.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    <li>
        Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
        additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
    </li>
    <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Enjoy!</li>
